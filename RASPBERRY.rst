Running on a Raspberry PI (aarch64)
===================================

*galacteek* runs on the Raspberry PI, but you will
need a 64-bit capable PI (PI 3b+, Pi 4, etc ..). You
will also need to be running the kernel in 64-bit mode.

This is a list of Linux distributions that will work well
for using galacteek on a PI (but any 64-bit system should
work):

- *Manjaro*
- *Arch Linux*
- *Void Linux*
- *Raspbian*

You'll probably want to run the IPFS daemon on another
machine and connect galacteek to that daemon.

AppImages and Flatpaks will be available shortly.
