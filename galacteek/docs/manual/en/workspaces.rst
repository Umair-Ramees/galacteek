Workspaces
==========

From the main toolbar you can access the different workspaces.
Each workspace has a different purpose and contains a tabbed
widget (some tabs are long-lived and non-closable, like the
filemanager).

Files workspace
---------------

This workspace hosts the filemanager. Anything opened by the
filemanager will appear on this workspace. Also, directories
which do not contain web pages will be opened here.

Planet-bound workspaces
-----------------------

These workspaces are bound to a specific planet. When opening
a hashmark which has tags matching one of the planets, the
document will be opened on the workspace corresponding to the
planet. With the exception of the workspace of *Earth*, all
other workspaces of this type are dormant and are only
activated when there's a match.

*Example*: you've bookmarked the wikipedia article of the
`Mars trojans <ipfs://bafybeiemxf5abjwjbikoz4mc3a3dla6ual3jsgpdr4cjr3oz3evfyavhwq/wiki/Mars_trojan.html>`_
with the tag **@Mars#trojan**. Once tagged, this document will
always be opened on the workspace of Mars.

Search workspace
----------------

This workspace is dedicated to searching content on the dweb.

Edition workspace
-----------------

This workspace contains tools (text editor, blog post writer)
to write documents stored on IPFS.

Network workspace
-----------------

This workspace shows the connected peers. From here you
can open the Atom feeds reader and connect to chat rooms.

Multimedia workspace
--------------------

This workspace hosts the mediaplayer.
