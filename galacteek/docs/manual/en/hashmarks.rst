Hashmarks
=========

Hashmarks are bookmarks for IPFS objects (that can be links to
directories, webpages, documents, text files, ...). Hashmarks
are referenced by the full IPFS path of the object and can contain
*fragments*.  These are all valid paths for hashmarks::

    /ipfs/zdj7WazZDaMUSua3wCKgjPAj9bZXbh2EMUHzFTEmHh1BUs2uH
    /ipfs/zdj7WazZDaMUSua3wCKgjPAj9bZXbh2EMUHzFTEmHh1BUs2uH/settings.html
    /ipfs/zdj7WazZDaMUSua3wCKgjPAj9bZXbh2EMUHzFTEmHh1BUs2uH/settings.html#ipfs-settings
    /ipns/dist.ipfs.io/favicon.ico

You can create hashmarks from many places, like in a browser tab,
or from the filemanager.

Pressing **Ctrl+b** from the browser will hashmark the current
page if it's a valid IPFS object. From the clipboard manager
you can create hashmarks as well, by opening the menu of the
clipboard item of your choice and clicking on the *Hashmark* action.

Hashmarks are given a a title, description and icon (that
will be stored within IPFS). You can also tag hashmarks
and give them an optional category.

Hashmarks collections can be synchronized from external git
repositories (the main repository is *dwebland*), so you need
to have git installed on your machine.

Hashmarks menu
--------------

From the toolbar, clicking on the hashmarks icon opens a menu
giving access to all your hashmarks, by category.

The *Popupar tags* shows the most active tags.

Clicking an item will trigger the opening of the corresponding
object, depending on its type (the file type of the object
is automatically detected and cached by the application). There
are built-in viewers/renderers for things like text files,
images, multimedia files etc.. For files that cannot be
rendered by the application (for example PDF files), the system's
default application will be used to open the file.

On Linux, you can use the *xdg-mime* command to change which
application will be used to open certain types of files,
for example this will use *mupdf* to open PDF files:

    xdg-mime default mupdf.desktop application/pdf

Search
^^^^^^

Your search query will be applied to the title, description,
comment or object path (so you can search for CIDs) of hashmarks,
as well as tags associated with the hashmark (so you can use
*#ipfs* or *@Earth#dweb* for example). The search is case-insensitive.

After typing a search query, run the search by pressing
**Shift + Return**.

RDF hashmarks store
===================

galacteek also supports storing hashmarks in a dedicated
RDF store. This is an experimental feature and is still being
evaluated.

When you search the *dweb* (with the existing engines, *ipfs-search*
and *cyber*), every available result will automatically be
cached in the RDF store, so that you will be able to easily
look them up later without having to query those engines.
Using linked data, references between objects are stored
as triples and makes it possible for example to trace back
which directory, which webpage contains a given image.

You can filter results by *MIME category* and set a limit on the
number of results. The search keywords are applied to the
title of the hashmark.

From the main toolbar and the search workspace you can access
the RDF hashmarks store and run searches. Right-clicking
a result allows you to copy the *IPFS path* of an entry.
Double-clicking an entry will open the corresponding object.

Following IPNS keys
===================

There is basic support for following IPNS names/keys. When browsing
an IPNS path (e.g **/ipns/awesome.ipfs.io**), open the IPFS
menu on the left, and click on **Follow IPNS resource**).

The IPNS name or key will be periodically resolved (the resolve frequency
is configurable) and you will be notified in the system tray when
new content is available.
