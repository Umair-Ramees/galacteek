UnixFS explorer
===============

The explorer shows the content of :term:`UnixFS` directories.

Usage
-----

Clicking the **Back** button (or hitting *Backspace*) will get
you one level up in the folder tree structure.

Drag-and-dropping files/directories from the explorer to the
filemanager is supported. Drag-and-drop a file on the tab
of the filemanager and it will be linked in the active
MFS directory.
