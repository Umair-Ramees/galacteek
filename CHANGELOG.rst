CHANGELOG
=========

Old CHANGELOG, see CHANGELOG.md

0.4.9
=====

- deps: use web3
- ipfssearch UI: implement a simple page factory, serving
  pre-generated search pages.
- ipfssearch: communication on the webchannel has been
  simplified. Hits are sent on the channel as soon as they
  are received; the JS code stores them right away in the
  DOM (hidden) but only makes them visible when the hit is
  valid (= we can at least fetch the object stat). We fetch
  multiple pages per 'virtual' page

0.4.8
=====

- Add tox as part of the travis build
- Add an 'invalid item' signal in the clipboard manager
- bugfix in the 'IPNS follow' action

0.4.7
=====

- Implementation of native ({ipfs,ipns}://) URL scheme handlers
  using async reqs (with aioipfs, no gateway)

0.4.6
=====

- Implement ENS resolver (ens:// URLs are supported in the browser)
- Replace most asyncio.wait_for() calls by async_timeout (performance)
